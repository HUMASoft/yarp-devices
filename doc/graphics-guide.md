# A short guide to creating dynamic charts
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) has a beautiful notebook that lets you write and execute code, analyze data, embed content, and share reproducible work.
Therefore, we will use Jupyter Notebook and python language, to process the test data previously stored in `cvs` files using the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library, and later visualize them in dynamic graphics thanks to the [plotly](https://plotly.com/) library, being able to expand them, move through them, select the lines that we want to visualize, see the values that make up each point of the lines, export the graph in an image, etc.
In addition, it allows us to visualize the code blocks that generate these graphs and to be able to modify them as we want. <br>

First of all, if we want to start creating a new graphic or modifying an existing one, we need to [install jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and start [running](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running) it. You can find multiple guides online to learn how to use jupyter, make graphs and publish them.
